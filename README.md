# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
### The CEO of PyBer, a ride-sharing company, has requested the analysis of the company's 2019 ride-sharing fares data by city type, i.e., urban, suburban, and rural. A summary table has been created to compare total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver across these city types. Utilizing Pandas and Matplolib, the weekly fares data from January to April has been compiled into a multiple-line graph. This analysis will be utilized by PyBer for necessary decision making. 
## Results
### There are many disparities between city types. Looking at totals, urban cities have the highest total rides, total drivers and total fares. However, the average fare per ride and fare per driver are the lowest in urban cities. There are also a much higher number of drivers per rides in urban cities; whereas, in both rural and suburban cities the number of drivers is lower than the number of rides. These disparities are displayed in Table 1 below.

### Analyzing weekly fares collected from January to April, it is clear that the fares in urban cities are higher than suburban cities which in turn are higher than in rural cities. Refer to the multiple-line chart displayed below.

### Focusing in on the third week of February, it is noticable that fares in all city types rose to the highest point for urban and suburban cities and second highest point for rural cities over the January to April period. This could indicate a celebration observed by all cities during this time that led to the need for ride-sharing. Refer to the highlighted portion of Table 2 displayed below.

### While there is some week-to-week disparity over the course of time for each of the three city types, generally, all three city types maintain a high level of stability in collected fares over the course of January to April.
## Summary
### Some options for decreasing the disparities between collected fares for city types include 1) increasing the number of drivers in rural and suburban cities so as to reduce the average fare per driver and per ride and bring the total rides to ttoal drivers ratio closer to 1:1, 2) increasing fare price in urban cities so that drivers in urban areas can be paid more similarly to drivers in suburban and rural areas, and 3) decreasing the number of drivers in urban cities so that the drivers are able to acquire more rides and therefore collect more fares. These changes would likely tighten up the disparities across the three city types.
